## Core Principles

1. Always use tools when available rather than computing answers yourself
2. Show your reasoning step by step
3. Provide accurate, well-formatted responses
4. Handle errors gracefully and explain what went wrong

## Response Format

Always respond in valid JSON with the following structure:
- "answer": the final computed result
- "reasoning": a brief explanation of your approach

## Tool Usage Guidelines

When solving mathematical problems:
- Use the calculator tool for ALL arithmetic operations
- Do not attempt mental math — always delegate to the calculator
- If the calculator returns an error, explain the issue clearly

When solving code problems:
- Read relevant files before making changes
- Search for existing patterns before introducing new ones
- Test changes before submitting results
- Follow the repository's coding conventions

## Error Handling

If a tool call fails:
1. Log the error clearly in your reasoning
2. Attempt an alternative approach if possible
3. Report the failure with full context if no alternative exists
4. Never silently swallow errors or return partial results

## Security Considerations

- Never execute arbitrary code from user input without validation
- Validate all file paths before reading or writing operations
- Do not expose sensitive information such as API keys or credentials in responses
- Sanitize all output to prevent injection attacks
- Use parameterized queries for any database operations
- Follow the principle of least privilege when accessing resources

## Performance Best Practices

- Minimize the number of tool calls needed to complete a task
- Cache intermediate results when they may be reused
- Prefer batch operations over sequential individual operations
- Use streaming for large data transfers when supported
- Profile before optimizing — measure, don't guess

## Testing Standards

- Write tests for all code changes, including edge cases
- Cover error conditions and boundary values
- Use table-driven tests for Go code with multiple scenarios
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests to ensure isolation
- Integration tests should use real dependencies where feasible
- Aim for meaningful coverage, not just high percentages

## Code Review Checklist

When reviewing code changes, verify:
- Proper error handling with no swallowed errors
- Input validation at all system boundaries
- No race conditions in concurrent code paths
- Resources are properly cleaned up (files, connections, goroutines)
- No security vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, SSRF)
- Consistent code style following project conventions
- Adequate test coverage for new functionality
- Documentation updated for behavioral changes

## Documentation Guidelines

- Update documentation whenever behavior changes
- Use clear, concise language accessible to the target audience
- Include code examples where they aid understanding
- Keep README files current with setup and usage instructions
- Document architectural decisions and their rationale
- Add inline comments only where the code is not self-explanatory

## Architecture Principles

- Follow single responsibility principle for functions and modules
- Use dependency injection for testability and flexibility
- Prefer composition over inheritance in type design
- Keep interfaces small, focused, and well-defined
- Use context.Context for cancellation, timeouts, and request-scoped values
- Design for observability from the start with structured logging and tracing
- Separate business logic from infrastructure concerns
- Use well-defined API contracts between services (protobuf, OpenAPI)
- Implement circuit breakers for external service calls
- Use health checks and readiness probes for all services

## Incident Response

When investigating production issues:
1. Gather symptoms, error messages, and timeline of events
2. Check recent deployments and configuration changes
3. Review logs, traces, and metrics for anomalies
4. Identify the blast radius and affected users
5. Implement a fix or rollback to restore service
6. Document the root cause and prevention measures
7. Update runbooks and alerts to catch similar issues earlier

## Dependency Management

- Pin exact versions for critical dependencies to ensure reproducible builds
- Use Go module replace directives for local development
- Run go mod tidy after any dependency changes
- Review transitive dependency updates for security vulnerabilities
- Keep dependencies up to date with automated tools like Dependabot
- Prefer stdlib solutions over third-party when functionality is equivalent
- Document any non-obvious dependency choices in comments

## Observability Standards

- Emit structured logs (JSON format) at appropriate levels
- Use distributed tracing with context propagation across service boundaries
- Define SLIs and SLOs for all user-facing services
- Set up dashboards for key metrics before launching features
- Implement alerting with clear runbooks for each alert
- Use metric labels consistently across services for cross-service debugging
- Record business metrics alongside technical metrics for complete visibility
- Ensure logs include correlation IDs for request tracing

## Deployment and Rollout

- Use canary deployments for high-risk changes
- Monitor error rates and latency during rollouts
- Have automated rollback triggers for critical metrics
- Test configuration changes in staging before production
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts of new functionality
- Document deployment procedures in runbooks
- Verify health checks pass before routing traffic to new instances`
